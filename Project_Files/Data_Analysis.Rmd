*STL Decomposition for Monthly Streamflow Analysis*
```{r}
# Load necessary libraries
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)

# Combine and sort data by year and month
monthly_df <- monthly_combined_all_sites %>%
  arrange(year, month)

# Create a time series object for STL decomposition
monthly_ts <- ts(monthly_combined_all_sites$mean_monthly_discharge_cfs, 
                 start = c(min(monthly_combined_all_sites$year), min(monthly_combined_all_sites$month)), 
                 frequency = 12)

# Perform STL decomposition with periodic seasonal component
monthly_stl <- stl(monthly_ts, s.window = "periodic")

# Plot the decomposition result
plot(monthly_stl, main = "STL Decomposition of Monthly Discharge")
```
The STL decomposition shows a sharp increase in discharge around September 2024, coinciding with the post-Hurricane Helene period. However, there is no clear upward trend in the “trend” component beyond this point. Instead, the trend stabilizes or slightly declines after the peak.
It’s important to note that the time series extends beyond the actual data range (which ends in March 2025), due to the structure of the ts() object. Therefore, any apparent patterns beyond this point are extrapolations by the STL function and not based on observed data.
Given the absence of repeated peaks or sustained increases, we do not observe a long-term increasing trend. This suggests the spike in discharge was likely a one-time event related to Hurricane Helene, rather than the beginning of a persistent upward shift in streamflow.

    test = list(Kendall::Kendall(1:n(), mean_monthly_discharge_cfs)),

A Mann-Kendall trend analysis was conducted for each of the 10 USGS gage sites in Western North Carolina to compare changes in streamflow before (2023–2024) and after (2024–2025) Hurricane Helene. The Kendall’s Tau (τ) statistic measures the direction and strength of monotonic trends in daily discharge, while the p-value indicates whether these trends are statistically significant.
Overall, most sites exhibited moderate increasing trends in the 2023–2024 period (positive τ values), with several declining or flattening in the 2024–2025 period. Specifically:
Bee Tree Creek Swannanoa, FBR Hot Springs, and Swannanoa Biltmore each showed significant upward trends (τ ≈ 0.71, p ≈ 0.035) prior to the hurricane.
However, all sites experienced either a weakened or reversed trend after the hurricane, with negative τ values in the 2024–2025 period, although none of these were statistically significant.
Sites such as FBR Marshall, Fletcher, and Rosman had moderate upward trends before the hurricane (τ ≈ 0.62, p ≈ 0.07), but these trends also diminished or reversed in the subsequent year.
These results suggest a regional hydrologic response marked by elevated discharge before the hurricane and more variable or declining patterns after, potentially reflecting the immediate impact of storm events followed by a period of hydrologic recovery or stabilization.

This displays Kendall’s Tau values by site and time period, highlighting the direction and significance of streamflow trends before and after Hurricane Helene. FBR Marshall and Fletcher both exhibited significant increasing trends in the 2023–2024 period, suggesting elevated streamflow prior to the hurricane. However, these trends reversed in 2024–2025, shifting to non-significant declines. Notably, Blantyre showed a significantly decreasing trend after the hurricane (τ < -0.2, p < 0.01), indicating a substantial drop in discharge in the post-storm period. This visual comparison reinforces the observation that while several sites experienced pre-hurricane increases in discharge, the post-hurricane year saw generally declining or neutral trends across the region.

This figure displays daily discharge (log scale) across 10 USGS gage sites in Western North Carolina during the 2023–2025 hurricane season. A noticeable increase in discharge is observed across most sites from early 2024, peaking around August–September, corresponding with Hurricane Helene. Larger rivers like Hot Springs and Marshall show higher and more stable discharge levels, while smaller ones  like Beetree Creek and Walkertown exhibit greater variability and sharper peaks. The overall pattern suggests a region-wide hydrologic response to seasonal rainfall and storm activity, with elevated discharge sustained into the fall before declining through early 2025.
